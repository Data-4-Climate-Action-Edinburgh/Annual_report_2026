# README - open data

Hadley Centre temperature files are in hierarchical .netcdf format, on a British Grid geospatial grid. Therefore, a script is used to transform the data to allow visualisation of the temperature for an area corresponding to the land covering a 5-mile radius around the ECCAN offices at 14 Forth Street in the centre of Edinburgh.
